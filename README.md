# Heart failure prediction Using ANN
This project is to help the albert hospital in predicting the heart failure patients in an early stage, which helps them in reducing the mortality rate in an effective way.

The dataset contains the risk factors like diabetes, tobacco, obesity etc of all the patients.

prediction with the help of ANN

## ðŸ›  Skills
Packages: pandas,numpy,matplotlib,sequential, tensorflow, scikit-learn, keras

## Importing the libraries

import numpy as np

import pandas as pd

import tensorflow as tf

## Lesson Learned


Artificial neural network works like human brain as a basis to develop algorithms that can be used to model complex patterns and prediction problems.

This project can be done in Machine learning as well but leads to computational cost and time complexity.
